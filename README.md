# Svelte News App

This is a hobby project whose only aim is to test the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework. Svelte 3 is finally able to work (mostly) well with [TypeScript](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript).

The project is a news headlines' reader, with links to the actual news sources, and it makes use of [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

## Development

Follow the instructions on `.env-sample` and place your NewsAPI key in your `.env` file.

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

And the development server:

```
yarn dev
```
